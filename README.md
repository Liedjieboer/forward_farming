The climate is changing and that inevitably means that the things dependent on the climate is changing too. That brings the question: How will farming practises change with the changing climate? This project looks at this question from the point of view that crops (more specifically wine grapes) could be cultivated in places where they would traditionally be expected not to flourish. Like Sheffield, UK. So our question is: When will Sheffield become the Champagne region of South Yorkshire?

After some research we found that a GDD (Growing Degree Days) of around 1500 would mirror the climate in the Champagne region in France, famous for its Chardonnay and Pinot Noir varieties. The model predicted that Sheffield will have a GDD of 1500 in 100 years or so (although we suspect it will be sooner...).

To further help us plot where exactly the best plots of land to use for viticulture would be, we used QGIS to show south-facing slopes with the right soil content, and to show the way the temperatures will be rising in those areas.

Then we used a NLP word generator to predict how wine connoisseurs will describe Sheffield wine in the future (and created the compulsory wordcloud accordingly).
