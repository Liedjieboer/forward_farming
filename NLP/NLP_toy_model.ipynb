       " ' Though some technical material is  included for background and flavor, it is not a technical dictionary;  what we describe here is the language hackers use among themselves for  fun, social communication, and technical debate',\n",
       " \"  The `hacker culture' is actually a loosely networked collection of  subcultures that is nevertheless conscious of some important shared  experiences, shared roots, and shared values\",\n",
       " ' It has its own myths,  heroes, villains, folk epics, in-jokes, taboos, and dreams',\n",
       " \" Because  hackers as a group are particularly creative people who define  themselves partly by rejection of `normal' values and working habits,  it has unusually rich and conscious traditions for an intentional  culture less than 40 years old\",\n",
       " \"  As usual with slang, the special vocabulary of hackers helps hold  their culture together -- it helps hackers recognize each other's  places in the community and expresses shared values and experiences\",\n",
       " '  Also as usual, not knowing the slang (or using it inappropriately)  defines one as an outsider, a mundane, or (worst of all in hackish  vocabulary) possibly even a [26]suit',\n",
       " ' All human cultures use slang in  this threefold way -- as a tool of communication, and of inclusion,  and of exclusion',\n",
       " '  Among hackers, though, slang has a subtler aspect, paralleled perhaps  in the slang of jazz musicians and some kinds of fine artists but hard  to detect in most technical or scientific cultures; parts of it are  code for shared states of consciousness',\n",
       " \" There is a whole range of  altered states and problem-solving mental stances basic to high-level  hacking which don't fit into conventional linguistic reality any  better than a Coltrane solo or one of Maurits Escher's `trompe l'oeil'  compositions (Escher is a favorite of hackers), and hacker slang  encodes these subtleties in many unobvious ways\",\n",
       " ' As a simple example,  take the distinction between a [27]kluge and an [28]elegant solution,  and the differing connotations attached to each',\n",
       " ' The distinction is  not only of engineering significance; it reaches right back into the  nature of the generative processes in program design and asserts  something important about two different kinds of relationship between  the hacker and the hack',\n",
       " ' Hacker slang is unusually rich in  implications of this kind, of overtones and undertones that illuminate  the hackish psyche',\n",
       " '  But there is more',\n",
       " ' Hackers, as a rule, love wordplay and are very  conscious and inventive in their use of language',\n",
       " ' These traits seem to  be common in young children, but the conformity-enforcing machine we  are pleased to call an educational system bludgeons them out of most  of us before adolescence',\n",
       " ' Thus, linguistic invention in most  subcultures of the modern West is a halting and largely unconscious  process',\n",
       " ' Hackers, by contrast, regard slang formation and use as a  game to be played for conscious pleasure',\n",
       " ' Their inventions thus  display an almost unique combination of the neotenous enjoyment of  language-play with the discrimination of educated and powerful  intelligence',\n",
       " \" Further, the electronic media which knit them together  are fluid, `hot' connections, well adapted to both the dissemination  of new slang and the ruthless culling of weak and superannuated  specimens\",\n",
       " ' The results of this process give us perhaps a uniquely  intense and accelerated view of linguistic evolution in action',\n",
       " '  Hacker slang also challenges some common linguistic and  anthropological assumptions',\n",
       " \" For example, it has recently become  fashionable to speak of low-context' versushigh-context'  communication, and to classify cultures by the preferred context level  of their languages and art forms\",\n",
       " ' It is usually claimed that  low-context communication (characterized by precision, clarity, and  completeness of self-contained utterances) is typical in cultures  which value logic, objectivity, individualism, and competition; by  contrast, high-context communication (elliptical, emotive,  nuance-filled, multi-modal, heavily coded) is associated with cultures  which value subjectivity, consensus, cooperation, and tradition',\n",
       " ' What  then are we to make of hackerdom, which is themed around extremely  low-context interaction with computers and exhibits primarily  \"low-context\" values, but cultivates an almost absurdly high-context  slang style?  The intensity and consciousness of hackish invention make a  compilation of hacker slang a particularly effective window into the  surrounding culture -- and, in fact, this one is the latest version of  an evolving compilation called the `Jargon File\\', maintained by  hackers themselves for over 15 years',\n",
       " ' This one (like its ancestors) is  primarily a lexicon, but also includes topic entries which collect  background or sidelight information on hacker culture that would be  awkward to try to subsume under individual slang definitions',\n",
       " '  Though the format is that of a reference volume, it is intended that  the material be enjoyable to browse',\n",
       " ' Even a complete outsider should  find at least a chuckle on nearly every page, and much that is  amusingly thought-provoking',\n",
       " ' But it is also true that hackers use  humorous wordplay to make strong, sometimes combative statements about  what they feel',\n",
       " ' Some of these entries reflect the views of opposing  sides in disputes that have been genuinely passionate; this is  deliberate',\n",
       " \" We have not tried to moderate or pretty up these disputes;  rather we have attempted to ensure that everyone's sacred cows get  gored, impartially\",\n",
       " ' Compromise is not particularly a hackish virtue,  but the honest presentation of divergent viewpoints is',\n",
       " '  The reader with minimal computer background who finds some references  incomprehensibly technical can safely ignore them',\n",
       " \" We have not felt it  either necessary or desirable to eliminate all such; they, too,  contribute flavor, and one of this document's major intended audiences  -- fledgling hackers already partway inside the culture -- will  benefit from them\",\n",
       " '  A selection of longer items of hacker folklore and humor is included  in [29]Appendix A',\n",
       " \" The `outside' reader's attention is particularly  directed to the Portrait of J\",\n",
       " ' Random Hacker in [30]Appendix B',\n",
       " '  Appendix C, the [31]Bibliography, lists some non-technical works which  have either influenced or described the hacker culture',\n",
       " '  Because hackerdom is an intentional culture (one each individual must  choose by action to join), one should not be surprised that the line  between description and influence can become more than a little  blurred',\n",
       " ' Earlier versions of the Jargon File have played a central  role in spreading hacker language and the culture that goes with it to  successively larger populations, and we hope and expect that this one  will do likewise',\n",
       " \"    * * *    Node:A Few Terms, Next:[32]Revision History,  Previous:[33]Introduction, Up:[34]Top  Of Slang, Jargon, and Techspeak  Linguists usually refer to informal language as `slang' and reserve  the term `jargon' for the technical vocabularies of various  occupations\",\n",
       " \" However, the ancestor of this collection was called the  Jargon File', and hacker slang is traditionallythe jargon'\",\n",
       " \" When  talking about the jargon there is therefore no convenient way to  distinguish it from what a linguist would call hackers' jargon -- the  formal vocabulary they learn from textbooks, technical papers, and  manuals\",\n",
       " '  To make a confused situation worse, the line between hacker slang and  the vocabulary of technical programming and computer science is fuzzy,  and shifts over time',\n",
       " ' Further, this vocabulary is shared with a wider  technical culture of programmers, many of whom are not hackers and do  not speak or recognize hackish slang',\n",
       " \"  Accordingly, this lexicon will try to be as precise as the facts of  usage permit about the distinctions among three categories:  `slang': informal language from mainstream English or    non-technical subcultures (bikers, rock fans, surfers, etc)\",\n",
       " \"  jargon': without qualifier, denotes informalslangy' language    peculiar to or predominantly found among hackers -- the subject of  this lexicon\",\n",
       " \"  `techspeak': the formal technical vocabulary of programming,    computer science, electronics, and other fields connected to  hacking\",\n",
       " '  This terminology will be consistently used throughout the remainder of  this lexicon',\n",
       " '  The jargon/techspeak distinction is the delicate one',\n",
       " ' A lot of  techspeak originated as jargon, and there is a steady continuing  uptake of jargon into techspeak',\n",
       " ' On the other hand, a lot of jargon  arises from overgeneralization of techspeak terms (there is more about  this in the [35]Jargon Construction section below)',\n",
       " '  In general, we have considered techspeak any term that communicates  primarily by a denotation well established in textbooks, technical  dictionaries, or standards documents',\n",
       " \"  A few obviously techspeak terms (names of operating systems,  languages, or documents) are listed when they are tied to hacker  folklore that isn't covered in formal sources, or sometimes to convey  critical historical background necessary to understand other entries  to which they are cross-referenced\",\n",
       " \" Some other techspeak senses of  jargon words are listed in order to make the jargon senses clear;  where the text does not specify that a straight technical sense is  under discussion, these are marked with `[techspeak]' as an etymology\",\n",
       " '  Some entries have a primary sense marked this way, with subsequent  jargon meanings explained in terms of it',\n",
       " '  We have also tried to indicate (where known) the apparent origins of  terms',\n",
       " ' The results are probably the least reliable information in the  lexicon, for several reasons',\n",
       " ' For one thing, it is well known that  many hackish usages have been independently reinvented multiple times,  even among the more obscure and intricate neologisms',\n",
       " \" It often seems  that the generative processes underlying hackish jargon formation have  an internal logic so powerful as to create substantial parallelism  across separate cultures and even in different languages! For another,  the networks tend to propagate innovations so quickly that `first use'  is often impossible to pin down\",\n",
       " ' And, finally, compendia like this one  alter what they observe by implicitly stamping cultural approval on  terms and widening their use',\n",
       " '  Despite these problems, the organized collection of jargon-related  oral history for the new compilations has enabled us to put to rest  quite a number of folk etymologies, place credit where credit is due,  and illuminate the early history of many important hackerisms such as  [36]kluge, [37]cruft, and [38]foo',\n",
       " ' We believe specialist  lexicographers will find many of the historical notes more than  casually instructive',\n",
       " '    * * *    Node:Revision History, Next:[39]Jargon Construction, Previous:[40]A  Few Terms, Up:[41]Top  Revision History  The original Jargon File was a collection of hacker jargon from  technical cultures including the MIT AI Lab, the Stanford AI lab  (SAIL), and others of the old ARPANET AI/LISP/PDP-10 communities  including Bolt, Beranek and Newman (BBN), Carnegie-Mellon University  (CMU), and Worcester Polytechnic Institute (WPI)',\n",
       " \"  The Jargon File (hereafter referred to as jargon-1' orthe File')  was begun by Raphael Finkel at Stanford in 1975\",\n",
       " ' From this time until  the plug was finally pulled on the SAIL computer in 1991, the File was  named AIWORD',\n",
       " 'RF[UP,DOC] there',\n",
       " ' Some terms in it date back considerably  earlier ([42]frob and some senses of [43]moby, for instance, go back  to the Tech Model Railroad Club at MIT and are believed to date at  least back to the early 1960s)',\n",
       " \" The revisions of jargon-1 were all  unnumbered and may be collectively considered `Version 1'\",\n",

       " \" He noticed  that it was hardly restricted to `AI words' and so stored the file on  his directory as AI:MRC;SAIL JARGON\",\n",
       " \"  The file was quickly renamed JARGON > (the `>' caused versioning under  ITS) as a flurry of enhancements were made by Mark Crispin and Guy L\",\n",
       " '  Steele Jr',\n",
       " \" Unfortunately, amidst all this activity, nobody thought of  correcting the term jargon' toslang' until the compendium had  already become widely known as the Jargon File\",\n",
       " '  Raphael Finkel dropped out of active participation shortly thereafter  and Don Woods became the SAIL contact for the File (which was  subsequently kept in duplicate at SAIL and MIT, with periodic  resynchronizations)',\n",
       " '  The File expanded by fits and starts until about 1983; Richard  Stallman was prominent among the contributors, adding many MIT and  ITS-related coinages',\n",
       " '  In Spring 1981, a hacker named Charles Spurgeon got a large chunk of  the File published in Stewart Brand\\'s \"CoEvolution Quarterly\" (issue  29, pages 26-35) with illustrations by Phil Wadler and Guy Steele  (including a couple of the Crunchly cartoons)',\n",
       " \" This appears to have  been the File's first paper publication\",\n",
       " '  A late version of jargon-1, expanded with commentary for the mass  market, was edited by Guy Steele into a book published in 1983 as \"The  Hacker\\'s Dictionary\" (Harper & Row CN 1082, ISBN 0-06-091082-8)',\n",

       " '  Shortly after the publication of Steele-1983, the File effectively  stopped growing and changing',\n",
       " \" Originally, this was due to a desire to  freeze the file temporarily to facilitate the production of  Steele-1983, but external conditions caused the `temporary' freeze to  become permanent\",\n",
       " '  The AI Lab culture had been hit hard in the late 1970s by funding cuts  and the resulting administrative decision to use vendor-supported  hardware and software instead of homebrew whenever possible',\n",
       " ' At MIT,  most AI work had turned to dedicated LISP Machines',\n",
       " \" At the same time,  the commercialization of AI technology lured some of the AI Lab's best  and brightest away to startups along the Route 128 strip in  Massachusetts and out West in Silicon Valley\",\n",
       " \" The startups built LISP  machines for MIT; the central MIT-AI computer became a [45]TWENEX  system rather than a host for the AI hackers' beloved [46]ITS\",\n",
       " '  The Stanford AI Lab had effectively ceased to exist by 1980, although  the SAIL computer continued as a Computer Science Department resource  until 1991',\n",
       " ' Stanford became a major [47]TWENEX site, at one point  operating more than a dozen TOPS-20 systems; but by the mid-1980s most  of the interesting software work was being done on the emerging BSD  Unix standard',\n",
       " '  In April 1983, the PDP-10-centered cultures that had nourished the  File were dealt a death-blow by the cancellation of the Jupiter  project at Digital Equipment Corporation',\n",
       " \" The File's compilers,  already dispersed, moved on to other things\",\n",

       " ' Even as the advent of the  microcomputer and other trends fueled a tremendous expansion of  hackerdom, the File (and related materials such as the [48]Some AI  Koans in Appendix A) came to be seen as a sort of sacred epic, a  hacker-culture Matter of Britain chronicling the heroic exploits of  the Knights of the Lab',\n",
